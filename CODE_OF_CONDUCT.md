## 2. Our Standards

- Being **respectful** in your communication and actions.
- Being **kind and welcoming** to newcomers.
- Using **inclusive language** and avoiding slurs or insults.

### 2.2. Unacceptable behavior

Examples of behavior that is **not** acceptable include:

- Harassment or discrimination of any kind, including:
  - offensive comments related to personal characteristics;
  - deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following;
  - personal attacks, trolling, or name-calling;
  - unwanted sexual or romantic attention.
- Publishing private information (doxxing), such as:
  - physical or email address,
  - private communication,

- Threats or encouragement of violence or self‑harm.
- Sustained disruption of conversations, reviews, or events.
- Insults, derogatory comments, or hostile language.
- Using project channels for:
  - spam, scams, or phishing,
  - illegal content,
  - explicit sexual content not relevant to the project.
- Any other behavior that **makes people feel unsafe or unwelcome**.

If you’re not sure whether something is appropriate, **assume it is not** and ask a maintainer privately.

---

## 3. Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:

- the **GitHub repository** (issues, pull requests, discussions, code reviews);
- the **documentation** and any content under the project’s control;
- **community spaces** related to ProdStarterHub
  (chat groups, forums, calls, etc., if they are officially linked to the project).

It also applies to your behavior when you are **representing the project** in any context, such as:

- presenting ProdStarterHub at a conference or meetup,
- engaging on social media as a maintainer or representative.

---

## 4. Reporting violations

If you believe a violation has occurred, or you feel unsafe or uncomfortable, please report it.

You can report by:

- Opening a **confidential issue** marked clearly as `Code of Conduct` (without sensitive details), and asking a maintainer to contact you privately, or  
- Contacting the maintainers directly (email or contact information listed in the repository, e.g. in `README` or `SECURITY`).

When reporting, if you feel comfortable, please include:

- Your name or preferred alias (you may remain anonymous if you prefer).
- What happened — a clear description of the behavior.
- Where it happened — link(s) to issues, PRs, comments, or logs if available.
- When it happened — approximate date / time.
- Whether it is ongoing.
- Any additional context that may help us understand the situation.

We will handle all reports **with care and discretion**:

- We will acknowledge your report as soon as reasonably possible.
- We will not share your identity outside the response team without your permission, unless we are legally required to.
- We will discuss possible outcomes with you when appropriate.

If you are unsure whether a situation is a violation, you can still report it.  
We would rather know about a concern early than too late.

---

## 5. Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this Code of Conduct.  
They may take any action they deem appropriate when unacceptable behavior is observed.

### 5.1. Enforcement guidelines

The following is a guideline for how we may respond to violations:

1. **Informal feedback**

   - **What:** A private reminder of this Code of Conduct and why the behavior was inappropriate.
   - **When:** For mild, first‑time issues where intent seems unclear.
   - **Goal:** Encourage reflection and improvement.

2. **Warning**

   - **What:** A clear warning, possibly with conditions (e.g. avoiding specific topics, changing tone).
   - **When:** For repeated minor violations or a more serious single incident.
   - **Goal:** Communicate that continued behavior will lead to stronger consequences.

3. **Temporary restrictions**

   - **What:** Temporarily limiting participation, such as:
     - disabling commenting on certain issues/PRs,
     - asking the person to pause contributions for a period of time,
     - temporarily blocking from the repository if necessary.
   - **When:** For persistent violations after a warning, or significant incidents that disrupt the project.
   - **Goal:** Protect the community while allowing time to reset and improve.

4. **Permanent ban**

   - **What:** Removal from the project and community spaces. May include:
     - permanent block from the repository,
     - removal from maintainers or collaborators,
     - revocation of special roles.
   - **When:** For very serious violations (e.g. threats, harassment, hate speech, doxxing), or repeated violations after other measures.
   - **Goal:** Protect the community from serious harm.

Enforcement decisions are made by the maintainers in good faith.  
We may adjust our response depending on the specifics of the situation.

---

## 6. Responsibilities of maintainers

Maintainers are expected to:

- Lead by example and follow this Code of Conduct in all project interactions.
- Address harmful behavior **promptly** and **fairly** when it is brought to their attention.
- Treat all reports seriously, even if they appear minor at first glance.
- Respect confidentiality, and not use reports as gossip or leverage.
- Step back from enforcement decisions if they are personally involved or in a conflict of interest.

---

## 7. Conflicts of interest

If you are reporting behavior involving a maintainer, or believe a maintainer might have a conflict of interest:

- Indicate this in your report (if safe to do so).
- Ask that another maintainer, or another member of the response team, handle the case.

We will do our best to ensure reports are reviewed by someone who is not directly involved in the incident.

---

## 8. Moderator actions in public spaces

Sometimes, moderation actions will be visible, such as:

- Locking a thread or discussion.
- Hiding or editing comments that violate the Code of Conduct.
- Adding notes that explain why a certain behavior is not acceptable.

We aim to:

- Keep moderation notes **informative, not humiliating**.
- Focus on explaining why content is problematic and how to do better.
- Avoid public arguments about enforcement; we prefer private channels for appeals or questions.

---

## 9. Appeals

If you disagree with an enforcement decision, you may request an appeal.

In your appeal, please include:

- Which decision you are appealing.
- Why you believe the decision was incorrect or unfair.
- Any additional context or information that was not previously considered.

We will review the appeal, possibly involve other maintainers, and respond once a decision is made.  
Decisions after appeal are generally considered final.

---

## 10. Attribution

This Code of Conduct is inspired by and adapted from common open‑source community standards, including (but not limited to):

- widely used open‑source project codes of conduct,
- community guidelines from major open‑source foundations.

It has been customized for the needs and goals of the **ProdStarterHub** project.

---

## 11. In short

- Be kind. Be respectful. Help each other.  
- Focus on ideas, not people.  
- If you’re unsure, ask — and listen to the answer.  
- If someone crosses a line, **tell us**. We will take it seriously.

Thank you for helping make **ProdStarterHub** a friendly and inclusive place for everyone. 💛
